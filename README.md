Homework #1: The search engine optimization of Horiseon

I first replaced all of the unecessary img lines of code in the style.css file and replaced it with a single img line of code. see line 164.

I then replaced all of the unessary h2 lines of code in the style.css file with a single line of code. I did this by giving all the h2 tags in the index.html file besides the footer a class of "ph2" which stands for paragraph heading 2s.

fixed seo in html link. (nav bar)

added a id tag to the Search Engine Optimization so the link would correctley work

deleted the unecessary h3 lines of code in the style.css file and replaced them with just the h3 because they all had the same modifications. It didn't make sense to have three things that serve the same purpose when you're able to just use one simple h3 tag instead.

deleted and replaced the three img tag lines of code in the style.css file and replaced them with one img line of code and added the max-height: 200px; into it. I also deleted the max-width: 150px; because it wasn't needed.

deleted the unecessary classes in the index.html file
