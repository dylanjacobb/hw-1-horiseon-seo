## **The Goal**
The goal of this project was to refactor the Horiseon website by ensuring all files/code met accessibility standards for optimal search engine optimization.

## **Changes Made**
I was able to do this by replacing many of the redundant syntax in the style.css file such as the unecessary img, h3, and paragraph selectors that were in the `<div class="content">`.

I also fixed the `<a href="#search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a>` link by adding the missing id tag to the first article of the `<div class="content">`.

In the index.html file, I found that I should replace some of the div tags with article instead as divs mostly used for content that is related to css in some way.

## **Overall Thoughts**
Throughout this assignment I feel like I've grown more accustomed to the proper layout of an html and css file. I'm sure I missed a couple things that could've been refactored, but this is a miles ahead of what I'd have been able to do a week ago.

 I was also able to get some practice with debugging in here due to a few errors on my part. In the few days I've worked on it it's definetly helped me become familiar with using git and github. Me constantly having to save my work and push it to Git Hub has been a big help in that aspect.
